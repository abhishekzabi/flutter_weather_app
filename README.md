This Flutter Weather App provides real-time weather updates using the Weather API. The app fetches the user's current location using the Geolocator and Geocoding packages to provide precise weather data. Key features include displaying the current temperature, weather conditions, and additional information like wind speed, humidity, and temperature ranges. The app also offers a next-day weather forecast, which users can access with a simple button tap.
